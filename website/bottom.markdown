## How to support the vmail project

If you find vmail very useful, feel free to drop me a note to say so. If you
have a bug to report or a good feature to suggest, please file it on the [issue
tracker][1].  Few things make this software developer happier than making good
software and knowing that people find my software useful.

Please do not feel obligated to donate money simply because you use vmail. But if you
want to donate some money to support the independent software developer behind
vmail, use this PayPal button:
